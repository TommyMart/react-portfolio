        The projects in my portfolio come from a mix of academic assignments,
        personal passion projects, and ongoing work. Some were built as part of
        structured coursework, where I applied theoretical knowledge to create
        real-world, functional applications. Others were developed purely for
        fun, driven by my curiosity to explore new technologies and sharpen my
        skills.

              This updated portfolio showcases my growth as a developer,
              building on my original site with a focus on modular components
              and improved user experience. Using Chakra UI instead of vanilla
              CSS, I created a cleaner, more responsive design that highlights
              my ability to work with reusable components and modern styling
              tools. Itâ€™s a testament to my progress and dedication to
              continuous improvement.

              One of my notable projects, completed as part of an assignment for
              which I received a high distinction, was my introduction to
              backend development and working with APIs. I built a RESTful API
              web server using Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, and PostgreSQL, where
              user information is authorised via JWT and securely hashed using
              Bcrypt. This project helped me develop a deep understanding of API
              architecture and secure user authentication systems.

              As part of an assignment for which I received a high distinction,
              I built a fully functional quiz night terminal application using
              Python, Bash scripting, and rich styling for an enhanced user
              experience. This project required creating an intuitive
              command-line interface, handling user input, and managing quiz
              logic and scoring. The use of Python allowed for efficient data
              processing, while Bash scripting helped automate various tasks
              within the terminal environment. This project significantly
              enhanced my understanding of backend logic and provided valuable
              experience in building interactive console applications.
